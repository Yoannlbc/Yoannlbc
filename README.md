## Hi there!ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Yoann Leblanc](https://www.yoannleblanc.com/), junior dev in France (Montpellier). 

After working for 15 years in the tourism industry as a travel advisor, I decided it was time for me to discover something else. Being curious by nature and always ready to learn new technologies, web development quickly became obvious. After following an intensive 2-month training course at Le Wagon, I was able to acquire the basics of several languages â€‹â€‹(Ruby, Javascript, HTML, CSS), certain frameworks like Rails, Stimulus or Heroku as well as database management with SQL. Even if being a beginner, feel free to explore my repositories.

## My projects :desktop_computer:
* [Senior Mentor](https://github.com/Rems31/senior_mentor): Senior Mentor is a Ruby-based website for renting services provided by "seniors": cooking classes, gardening, stories told like our grandparents did... "Airbnb clone" project carried out during the Wagon training in teams of three. 
* [Cavinum](https://github.com/Rems31/Cavinum): Cavinum is a Ruby-based web application that allows you to manage your wine cellar in a simple and intuitive way. This was the final project for Le Wagon, which we had to complete in teams of three.
* [Vinyles Flow](https://vinylesflow-ecf702fa9221.herokuapp.com/): Vinyles Flow is my first solo project after the training. It's a web application developed in Ruby that allows you to manage your vinyl collection.
